Audiofunctions+ is a web app designed to facilitate visually impaired students’ learning of mathematical functions. Audiofunctions+ allows users to interpret the shape of a function’s graph by listening to its sonification.  
Audiofunctions+ is one of the deliverables of the [SONAIRGRAPH](https://sonairgraph.unito.it/) Erasmus+ project.
